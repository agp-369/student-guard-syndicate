# StudentGuard Syndicate: Submission Assets

---

## 📝 The Publishing Post (For DEV.to)
**Title:** Honestly, I'm tired of students getting scammed. So I built The Syndicate.

*This is a submission for the [DEV Weekend Challenge: Community](https://dev.to/challenges/weekend-2026-02-28)*

### The Community
I built this for every student who’s ever felt that pit in their stomach after getting a "too good to be true" job offer. Honestly, it's insane how many people I know who have been targeted by fake LinkedIn recruiters. Students are the perfect targets—we’re hungry for experience, we’re new to the corporate world, and we really, really need that first internship. 

I wanted to build something that wasn't just another boring "security tool." I wanted to build an immune system.

### What I Built
**StudentGuard Syndicate** is an immersive, sovereign defense network. It moves beyond private scanning by turning every detection into collective intelligence.
- **Forensic Probe:** Our engine doesn't just "read" text. It actively extracts URLs and pings global RDAP registries to see if a domain was registered... like, yesterday.
- **Sovereign PDF Node:** Using WebAssembly, we parse sensitive offer letters locally in your browser RAM. Your data stays yours.
- **Global Intelligence Hub:** A live, decentralized ledger where students share scam signatures to warn others in real-time.
- **Sovereign Passport:** A cryptographic identity card for members to prove their status in the Syndicate.

### How I Built It
I went all-in on Next.js 15 and the latest AI models.
- **Intelligence:** Powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash**—the speed is actually wild for forensic analysis.
- **Backend:** Supabase handles the real-time community threat Board.
- **Forensics:** Custom RDAP/WHOIS probe logic integrated directly into the Next.js API nodes.
- **Vibe:** I spent a ridiculous amount of time on the "Hacker OS" UI. I wanted it to feel like you're in a Command Center, not a blog.
