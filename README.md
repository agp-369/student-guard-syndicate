StudentGuard Syndicate is a high-fidelity, sovereign community defense network designed to weaponize collective intelligence against recruitment fraud. Unlike traditional scanners, the Syndicate uses multi-layer forensics—extracting hidden metadata and pinging global DNS registries—to build a decentralized immune system for students entering the workforce.

## 🏛️ Core Architectural Protocols

### 1. Forensic DNA Probing
The engine doesn't just read text; it interrogates it. Our backend actively extracts URL entities and pings global **RDAP/WHOIS** registries to identify the registration age of target domains.
*   *Heuristic:* Any domain under 180 days old claiming to be a major corporation triggers a **Critical Threat Alert**.

### 2. Sovereign PDF Node (Privacy-First)
Career documents contain highly sensitive personal data. Upholding our **Sovereign Mandate**, we leverage **WebAssembly (pdfjs-dist)** to parse PDF offer letters entirely within the user's browser RAM. No sensitive data ever touches our servers.

### 3. Synchronized Community Ledger
Every neutralization is logged to a real-time, anonymous public ledger powered by **Supabase**. One student's scan strengthens the immune system of the entire global network.

### 4. Viral Dispatch Engine
When a threat is neutralized, the system generates high-fidelity **Imperial Cyber-Seal Dispatches**. These graphics are optimized for social node distribution (LinkedIn/X), allowing students to warn their peers with professional-grade security assets.
